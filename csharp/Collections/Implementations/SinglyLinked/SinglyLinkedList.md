# Singly Linked List
Consider a very trivial singly linked list. The following are the details but basically

1. Adding to the front or back are constant time O(1)
2. Removal from the back is constant time O(1)
3. Removal from the back is O(N) because we dont have a back pointer
4. Removal from the middle is O(N) as we require a traversal
5. Contains is O(N) because we dont have a back pointer
